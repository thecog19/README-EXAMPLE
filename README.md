# README-EXAMPLE

## Introduction 
This is a project to create a basic template for solid readmes. The hope is that this will enable other developers to write good documentation as well as good code. It exists as a simple markdown file in a github repository. Anyone can download it and modify it. 

## Documentation 
If there were any further documentation, it would be [Linked here]()

## Setup Instructions
We assume here you have installed software the can extract zip files, and also that you are working a linux based enviorment. If you do not have an utility for unzipping installed, you can install `unzip`, [reference here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/86849/how-to-unzip-a-zip-file-from-the-terminal).
If you want to simply use this markdown file, do the following:

1. Click the green button that says "clone or download"
2. Click download as ZIP
3. Extract the content of the downloaded file to a folder of your choice
4. Modify the file and include it in your project

If you want to contribute, you can clone the project, and make a pull request: 
1. `git clone https://github.com/thecog19/README-EXAMPLE.git`
2. `git checkout -b YOUR-BRANCH-NAME`
3. Make your changes
4. Add, commit and push your changes
5. Open a pull request via the pull request tab on github

## Examples
You might take this file, and replace the introduction text with something like this: 
"This is the foobar library, for generating foobars. We generate foobars because they are important"

Then you could copy and paste your modied file into your project, by using the `cp` command

`cp README.md /path/to/project/`
